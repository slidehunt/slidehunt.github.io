This 101-acre park, located near the south shore of the Columbia River, includes playing fields, boat houses, picnic areas, ponds, wooded areas, a lake and a wetland. There is a 40 mile paved loop that runs through the park and is open to hiking and biking. There is a 3,500 square foot spray playground stocked with fun activities that give children plenty of room to run around. When youâ€™ve had enough hearing the squeals coming from the spray playground, you and your family will find ample space to roam and enjoy the peace and quiet that this serene park can provide.
